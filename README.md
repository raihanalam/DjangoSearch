<br>
This is a search history tracker application. We can use it on various type of applicaton.
Which will take every hit on a search bar.
It will take history of every search, with some importan data like search key, user, browser, ip, time or more.
All data will save on SQL database.
After that we can filter out all search history via the django ORM by keyword, user and time range.
In filtering I used some techniqe like showing all results without loading the page with some Javascript and AJAX.
